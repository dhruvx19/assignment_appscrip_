# Flutter Project

Welcome to the Flutter Project! This is a starting point for a Flutter application designed to demonstrate various features and functionalities.

## Features

- **API Integration using BLoC**: The project integrates with a REST API using the BLoC pattern for state management, ensuring a clean separation between business logic and UI.
- **Search Bar Functionality**: A dynamic search bar allows users to filter through a list of items seamlessly.
- **More Details Page**: Detailed view of individual items with expanded information based on the selected item.
- **Smooth UI and Scrollbar**: A user-friendly interface with smooth scrolling and a visible scrollbar for enhanced navigation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Flutter SDK
- Dart
- An editor like VS Code or Android Studio

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
   ```sh
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the app**:
   ```sh
   flutter run
   ```

## Features

### API Integration using BLoC

- The app fetches data from a REST API using the `http` package.
- BLoC (Business Logic Component) is used for managing states and handling business logic.

### Search Bar Functionality

- A search bar is implemented in the main UI to filter and display items based on user input.
- The search functionality is integrated with the BLoC state management for real-time updates.

### More Details Page

- Each item in the list can be selected to navigate to a detailed page.
- The details page displays additional information such as address and other related fields.

### Smooth UI and Scrollbar

- The UI is designed for a smooth user experience with responsive layouts.
- A scrollbar is added for easy navigation through long lists.

## API Integration

The app uses the following API endpoint to fetch data:

- **Endpoint**: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`
- **Response Fields**: `id`, `name`, `username`, `email`, `address`, `phone`, `website`, `company`

## BLoC State Management

The BLoC pattern is used for managing the state of the app. The following BLoC components are included:

- **UsersBloc**: Handles fetching of users and state updates.
- **UsersEvent**: Defines events for user actions.
- **UsersState**: Defines various states like loading, success, and failure.
